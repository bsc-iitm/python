This section contains the practice programming problems (PPAs) used in the course organized week-wise. Each PPA has a separate page dedicated to it. There are three components to each PPA:

- Question
- Hint
- Solution


::: {.callout-warning}
We earnestly request you to first attempt a question for about $15$ minutes without looking at any external resource. If you are not able to make any headway, look at the hint. Spend another $15$ minutes and see if you can solve the problem with the hint. If you are still not able to figure out the solution, you can refer to the one provided by us. 

If you directly head to the solution, you are cheating yourself and you will learn NOTHING in the process. Take this as a friendly suggestion from our side, and we hope you will make the best use of this resource. Test cases will not be provided. You have to head to the portal to verify the correctness of your solution. Finally, if you are able to solve the problem yourself, congratulations. You can compare your solution with the one provided by us and learn different ways of approaching the same problem.
