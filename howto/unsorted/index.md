This contains a collection of short snippets of code that explain how to do something in Python. A very small number of how-tos have a video to accompany them. These how-tos are organized topic wise. Look for the categories on the right panel. The ideal way to go through these how-tos is to pick a topic and go through each how-to from top to bottom, left to right. Alternatively, you could try to search for a particular how-to by entering some keywords in the filter box given below.
