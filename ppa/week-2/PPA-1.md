## Question

Accept a non-zero integer as input. Print `positive` if it is greater than zero and `negative` if it is less than zero.

## Hint

```python
if x > 0:
    print('positive')
```

Can you complete it?

## Solution

```python
x = int(input())
if x > 0:
    print('positive')
elif x < 0:
    print('negative')
```
