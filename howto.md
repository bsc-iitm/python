A collection of how-tos organized topic wise. The topics are themselves arranged in the following sequence:

- Input-output
- Strings
- Loops
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Tuples and Sets
- File handling
- Exceptions

These are best read sequentially. However, if you are familiar with a particular topic and want a quick revision, directly jump into it.
